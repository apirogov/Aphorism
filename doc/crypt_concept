user registers - RSA pair generated

server gets:
private key AEScrypted with users password + public key + loginpwd-SHA256
-> only user on client side can decrypt stuff

login:
  server checks loginpwd-hash
  ok -> sends crypted private key
  sends random session communication key crypted with public key
  
  client: decrypts private key with loginpwd
          decrypts sessioncommunicationkey with private key

-> from now on communication between server and client
   is crypted with AES with the shared communication key!!!

-> THE GOOD THING: No middleman can do anything with the traffic 
	-> client <--> browser communication secure

communication client<->client: PGP-like:
	Alice requests Bob's public key from server
	random message crypt password generated
	message crypted with AES
	password crypted with Bob's public key
	packaged -> sent to server -> sent to Bob
	Bob decrypts password with private key
	Bob decrypts message
-> THE GOOD THING: The server just knows that information is
	shared between Alice and Bob, but can't read it!!!

MAYBE I will one day port the whole thing to HTTPS...
